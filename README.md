# vistan_mrp_predictions
Shows how to produce epreds in pure Stan for an MRP example.

Pretty simple, just wanted to show how to do this for a brms model since it's a common first "pure stan" task people search for.

To get more context, I'd reccomend the [blog post](https://andytimm.github.io/posts/Variational%20MRP%20Pt7/variational_mrp_pt7.html) this model is used in.
